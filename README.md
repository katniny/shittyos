# ShittyOS
The name explains it.

It's simply just an OS that makes the background brown then prints a string.

That's it.

You can use it to learn or whatever. MIT because it's just 45 lines of assembly, it's not that special.

## Using ShittyOS
If you dare do this, we provide an .img file in the Releases that you can run in a VM... or on real hardware. It can't be installed, so it won't damage your computer or whatever. If it does damage your PC though somehow, I'm not responsible!
